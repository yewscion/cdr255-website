# cdr255-website

`cdr255-website` is a literate programming repository for my [main
website](https://cdr255.com/), including the HTML5, CSS3, and any
extensions. All media assets (binary files of some sort) will be
hosted on [linode](https://linode.com/).

## Installation

If You want to create a tangled (production-ready) version of the
website with this repo, clone it locally. Open the `cdr255.org` file
in GNU/Emacs, and type `C-c C-v t` to tangle all of the files into
their correct places. The `/public` directory is the production-ready
site, and a version of it is likely currently live at
[cdr255.com](https://cdr255.com/).

## Usage

I have developed this site using a lot of concepts from Literate
Programming, and leveraging Org Babel to keep things organized.

## Contributing
Pull requests are not welcome, aside from efficiency/refactoring, as
this is the repo of a personal site. However, feel free to use it as a
base for Your own site, if You wish.
