* Overview
  This is the literate programming file for my [[https://cdr255.com][main website]], which I'm
  using to convert my old website into an org-based format (and then
  keep it up to date).
* Build Script
  I'm basing this concept off of the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfkrzFodoNw][System Crafters]] tutorial which
  was recently posted.

  The tutorial splits the build into an Elisp script that does all of
  the actual work, and a bash script that wraps it for an easier CI
  integration in the future.

  I don't think I'll need the CI integration here, but there's no real
  reason /not/ to separate it out like that.

              Decided to finally do a renovation on this site.
            </p>
            <p>
              (The last update was over three years ago, so I'd say it was long
              overdue!)
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm mostly keeping the content the same for now, as I want to
              focus on converting the old site to the new format first.

              <h4>Thirteen Point Three</h4>
              <p>
                This is was my first (and only) entry into the 2017 <code>/r/songaweek</code>
                challenge!
              </p>
              <p>
                The theme was "Off by One", which I took a few different
                ways. First, I chose to write this piece in 5/4. Second, I chose
                to make this a three section piece (instead of my usual
                two). Finally, I tried to tell the (yet to be written out) story
                of Vir, a demigod in the fantasy story I'm currently working on
                whose trials and tribulations ultimately meant their own
                demise&#x2026; But not before their duty was done, which resulted in
                their demigodhood.

                It was silent, save for the fan in the corner.

              <p>
                These big, metal boxes with grates on four sides were
                everywhere, and they all worked tirelessly to do two things:
                take in the old, stale air and revitalize it for another
                use, and pump the result back out into the same room. They
                were absolutely necessary, in a place with no trees or other
                flora to do the same job, and because of this it was vital
                that they remain clean and in working order.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Christopher Rodriguez.
          </p>
          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a huge proponent of Free Software and Free Culture. My OS of
            choice is
            <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a>.
            Most of my work is released under either the
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html">LGPL v3.0+</a>
            or
            <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA 4.0</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I consider myself more of a software nerd than a hardware
            nerd. I am an unrepentent
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisper</a>;
            The first language I reach for is
            <a href="https://common-lisp.net/">Common Lisp</a>,
            but I use
            (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">GNU Guile</a>)
            <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/">Scheme</a>,
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/">Emacs Lisp</a>,
            and
            <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> when the situation
            calls for them. I especially
            like
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_processing">Text Processing</a> and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language">Data Manipulation</a>.
            For databases I prefer <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I maintain a couple of websites other than this one. Here are
            the main ones:
          </p>
          <ul class="org-ul">
            <li>
              <a href="https://yewscion.com/">Yewscion</a> - My Tech
              Blog.</li>
            <li><a href="http://proseandprosody.com">Prose and Prosody</a> -
            My Fiction Site.</li>
            <li><a href="http://tumblingowl.com">Tumbling Owl</a> - My Game
            Site.</li>
            <li><a href="http://toftandtoddy.com">Todt and Toddy</a> - My
            Music Site.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            As for this site, it is meant to be a hub of sorts for
            everything I publish, along with a repository of any content
            that doesn't fit on other sites (my homepage).
          </p>
          <h3>Games</h3>
          <p>
            I am, and always have been, an avid gamer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've recently moved more towards tabletop gaming, especially
            boardgames. I am active
            on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/user/yewscion">BoardGameGeek</a>. I've
            published relatively little of my own gaming content, though I
            still have some stuff in the works.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for video gaming, I prefer DRM-free releases and FLOSS
            projects when possible. I also prefer strategy / simulation
            games to the more twitchy ones, and much prefer a keyboard to a
            controller.
          </p>
          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>
            I am a Harper, a Composer, and an Irish Traditional Musician.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love instrumental music the best, and have a large personal
            collection of MIDI and MOD files. Music I listen to in a wave
            format is usually stored in FLAC files. That said, I like all
            music, from Rap to Rock to Country to Metal.
          </p>
          <p>
            My own music is usually published in MIDI form at first, usually
            using <a href="https://lilypond.org">GNU Lilypond</a>. Then I
            will teach myself to play it on one instrument or another and
            make a recording of it after I'm happy with the MIDI
            composition. Unless otherwise stated, all of my work is

          <h3>Writing</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy reading and writing, but more as a hobby that anything
            else.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have many ongoing series on my Fiction Site, on which I
            publish little serial releases irregularly. The stories within I
            hope to use as the backdrop for my music or games eventualy,
            though its my hope that they will stand on their own as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day I may publish some of my work in a hard copy. If I do, it
            will be referenced here.

           <p>
             With this series, I wanted to see how I would design the music
             for a standard jRPG from the 90's. I don't have a story to go

             An Idea I had while I was watching some movies turned into a

             nature of life, depending upon one's current perspective.

           <p>
             Two engaged lovers find an antique dress at a pawn shop and
             compete in a dangerous sport to win it. A cyberpunk romantic
             tragedy with horrific undertones. And each scene is going to
             have a piece of music associated with it.
