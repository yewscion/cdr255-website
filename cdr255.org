* Overview
  This is the literate programming file for my [[https://cdr255.com][main website]], which I'm
  using to convert my old website into an org-based format (and then
  keep it up to date).
* Build Script
  I'm basing this concept off of the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfkrzFodoNw][System Crafters]] tutorial which
  was recently posted.

  The tutorial splits the build into an Elisp script that does all of
  the actual work, and a bash script that wraps it for an easier CI
  integration in the future.

  I don't think I'll need the CI integration here, but there's no real
  reason /not/ to separate it out like that.

            <p>
              Decided to finally do a renovation on this site.

            <p>
              (The last update was over three years ago, so I'd say it was long

            </p>
            <p>
              I'm mostly keeping the content the same for now, as I want to
              focus on converting the old site to the new format first.

              <h4>Thirteen Point Three</h4>
              <p>
                This is was my first (and only) entry into the 2017 <code>/r/songaweek</code>
                challenge!
              </p>
              <p>
                The theme was "Off by One", which I took a few different
                ways. First, I chose to write this piece in 5/4. Second, I chose
                to make this a three section piece (instead of my usual
                two). Finally, I tried to tell the (yet to be written out) story
                of Vir, a demigod in the fantasy story I'm currently working on
                whose trials and tribulations ultimately meant their own
                demise&#x2026; But not before their duty was done, which resulted in
                their demigodhood.

                These big, metal boxes with grates on four sides were
                everywhere, and they all worked tirelessly to do two things:
                take in the old, stale air and revitalize it for another
                use, and pump the result back out into the same room. They
                were absolutely necessary, in a place with no trees or other
                flora to do the same job, and because of this it was vital
                that they remain clean and in working order.

              </p>
              <p>
                I consider myself more of a software nerd than a hardware
                nerd. I am an unrepentent

                but I use

                As for this site, it is meant to be a hub of sorts for

              <h3>Games</h3>
              <p>
                I am, and always have been, an avid gamer.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've recently moved more towards tabletop gaming, especially
                boardgames. I am active
                on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/user/yewscion">BoardGameGeek</a>. I've
                published relatively little of my own gaming content, though I
                still have some stuff in the works.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for video gaming, I prefer DRM-free releases and FLOSS
                projects when possible. I also prefer strategy / simulation
                games to the more twitchy ones, and much prefer a keyboard to a
                controller.

              <h3>Music</h3>
              <p>
                I am a Harper, a Composer, and an Irish Traditional Musician.
              </p>
              <p>
                I love instrumental music the best, and have a large personal
                collection of MIDI and MOD files. Music I listen to in a wave
                format is usually stored in FLAC files. That said, I like all
                music, from Rap to Rock to Country to Metal.
              </p>
              <p>
                My own music is usually published in MIDI form at first, usually
                using <a href="https://lilypond.org">GNU Lilypond</a>. Then I
                will teach myself to play it on one instrument or another and
                make a recording of it after I'm happy with the MIDI
                composition. Unless otherwise stated, all of my work is
                published
                under
                <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA
                  4.0</a>.

              <h3>Writing</h3>
              <p>
                I enjoy reading and writing, but more as a hobby that anything
                else.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have many ongoing series on my Fiction Site, on which I
                publish little serial releases irregularly. The stories within I
                hope to use as the backdrop for my music or games eventualy,
                though its my hope that they will stand on their own as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                One day I may publish some of my work in a hard copy. If I do, it
                will be referenced here.

                <h3>Dorsht Seeker</h3>
                <p>The <dfn>Dorsht</dfn> are a race of mountain dwellers who live
                  inside the Kingdom of Falode, but maintain their own “country”
                  (in the mountain range to the South of Beebrook) through a
                  special alliance with the King. They have coarse, muted hair
                  that they often braid or dye, rough, pale brown skin from
                  spending so much of their lives indoors, and a stockier, rounder
                  build than those of the Falodians.</p>
                <p><dfn>Seekers</dfn> are those of the Dorsht who leave the
                  mountains in search of something, be it technology, absolution,
                  or purpose. There are thus many reasons the Dorsht might become
                  adventurers. Many will eventually return to the mountains; Those
                  that don’t before their demise become the new target for some
                  other Seeker.</p>
                <p>The Dorsht wear face paint each and every day. This face paint
                  is both reflective of their role in their society, their
                  personal history, and what they value in life. Each Dorsht has a
                  glyph that they alone are prescribed, which stays with them
                  through their entire lives and adorns their face each waking
                  day. This is the minimum they are willing to resort to, if they
                  cannot access their paints or doing so would be
                  inappropriate.</p>

                <h3>Ehdrin Traveler</h3>
                <p>The <dfn>Ehdrin are a reclusive people from the Isthmus beyond
                    the Western Borders of Falode. They are a tall, golden-tawny
                    people with brightly colored hair. Both their men and women have
                    no facial hair to speak of, though they tend to decorate their
                    hair with styling and beads.</p>
                <p>They are largely a reclusive people, rarely allowing foreigners
                  to come into contact with them. As a result, most Ehdrin
                  Adventurers are designated (in one way or another)
                  as <dfn>Travelers</dfn> for the Ehdrin: Ambassadors who ‘travel
                  the world looking for any events which might bring trouble to
                  the Ehdrin’ and are expected to report back, should something of
                  any magnitude come to pass.</p>
                <p>Ehdrin Travelers are, before their departure (or their exile) given
                  two tattoos: One on the back of each hand. The left is a regional one
                  that relates to their life before becoming a traveler. The right is a
                  personal, individual symbol used to identify them, and only
                  them. Through magic, these tattoos are echoed through their skin onto
                  their very bones, so that they might be identified should only their
                  skeleton remain intact.</p>

                <h3>Falodian Noble</h3>
                <p>The <dfn>Noble Class</dfn> in the Kingdom of Falonde is charged
                  with “Upholding the honor of Falonde to ourselves and others.”
                  They are fair-skinned, with dark brown or black hair. They
                  nearly all have violet eyes; Other colors are seen as a mixed
                  heritage of some sort. They tend to be of average height, with
                  women being slightly shorter than men.</p>
                <p>Nobles in Falode are charged with being observant and inclusive of all
                  around them at the expense of knowing history or studying. Though they
                  are the ‘ruling class’ of Falode, they view themselves lower than
                  others: They have been charged with a Duty to keep things working and
                  help others to live their lives in exchange for the resources and
                  freedom to enact that as best as they can from the Queen and King.</p>
                <p>Each Noble Family has a different Charge, with grouped families
                  sharing the same colors.  The rest of the specific coat of arms is
                  chosen by the individual, and all Nobles must have a coat of arms on
                  record with the king. They are given a set of ceremonial armor in
                  their family’s colors, which they are very used to wearing at all
                  formal events.</p>

                <h3>Falodian Commoner</h3>
                <p>Unlike Nobles, the <dfn>Peasantry</dfn> of the Kingdom of
                  Falode do not uphold much other than themselves (and
                  occasionally each other). They, as the nobles, tend to be fair
                  skinned, but have lighter colored hair and blue or brown
                  eyes. They tend to be of average height, with women slightly
                  shorter than men.</p>
                <p>Commoners try to eke out enough of a living to survive, and are
                  often forced to do manual labor of some sort. Their culture, in
                  possible response to the more world-mindedness of the nobles, is
                  very self involved. They become used to running, as time is a
                  premium and danger haunts the less populated areas. But, they
                  are quick learners, and become very good at what they choose to
                  do.</p>
                <p>Far from the complex coat of arms the Nobles concern themselves
                  with, each Commoner family gets their own secret sign, which
                  along with short symbols (like danger, friendly, emergency, and
                  such) form a sort of language used to communicate
                  information. This varies somewhat from town to town, but the big
                  symbols always stay the same (and family symbols are always
                  different).</p>

                <h3>Khula Trader</h3>
                <p>The <dfn>Khula</dfn> are a race of brown-skinned people who’ve
                  settled to the North of Beebrook, just outside the limits of the
                  Kingdom of Falode. They have coarse, dark hair, and green (and
                  sometimes hazel or brown) eyes. They are on the shorter side,
                  with women being taller than men.</p>
                <p>The Khula are an industrious people. The land they’ve decided
                  to call home is relatively isolated; what they cannot obtain
                  naturally they trade for from others. This has created a class
                  of Khula <dfn>Traders</dfn>, who leave their country regularly
                  in an effort to procure items, deals, and connections for their
                  homeland. Though it’s expected they return regularly, provided
                  they remain in contact with the Khula they can be out in the
                  field for years at a time.</p>
                <p>Each Khula Trader is given a cane, decorated with symbols
                  representing their family, their deeds, and their
                  specialties. They thus accumulate a breadth of symbols over the
                  course of their lives, but none is so important as the top of
                  the cane, which is often an ornate crystal of some kind, set
                  with a design that is uniquely their own.</p>

                <h3>Viliniti Diasporan</h3>
                <p>The <dfn>Viliniti</dfn> used to live in what is now Eastern
                  Falode. They are a short people with ochre colored skin and dark
                  colored hair and eyes. They are graceful, both in movement and
                  deed, but their rather sparse way of life leaves them more frail
                  than others.</p>
                <p>The Viliniti now live among the Falode in small, discrete
                  groups. Though Eastern Falode belonged to them a few centuries
                  ago, there are only a small number of people who still feel they
                  should not cooperate with the Kingdom (to a point- they still
                  look out for their own, just without active rebellion). They are
                  naturally migratory, and thus any Viliniti might become an
                  adventurer.</p>
                <p>The Viliniti have always had a ‘knack with animals’. They have
                  a heightened sense of smell, and seem to be able to communicate
                  fairly well with animals around them. They spend a lot of their
                  lives travel ling, and have developed watchful eyes to prevent
                  themselves from falling under misfortune.</p>
                <p>Every Viliniti has a necklace with charms on it to remember
                  important events in their life- including their birth. They are
                  very protective of this necklace, though they have more than
                  memorized each symbol it holds, and can recount with unerring
                  detail each part of it, should it be destroyed. But, only a very
                  small number of things will force a Viliniti to sacrifice their
                  necklace.</p>

              <h1>Falodian Pantheon</h1>
              <p>This is the officially recognized pantheon for the Kingdom of Falode.</p>
              <p>It is by no means exhaustive; Other Gods and Goddesses are worshipped
                throughout the land, but are either too minor or too contrary to be
                officially noted here yet. Every major metropolitan area in Falode is
                required by Royal Law to have a shrine to each of these deities. Small
                towns, of course, are not.</p>
              <p>The Deities of the Falodian Pantheon form themselves into various groups.</p>
              <p>Firstly, the Hierarchy: There were once only ten deities. Of these ten,
                two stood up and took control: Alil and Jeha. They took up the cause
                of defending the Fates. The others would defer to them, but keep their
                own individuality for the most part, and became Beholden to the
                Fates. Over time, various Children were born to them all: They became
                the Children of the Fates.</p>
              <p>Secondly, there are groupings based on Status and Culture: Gods and
                Goddesses, first, to promote an easy way to divide the group. Then,
                there were some who began work on some… questionable goals. These
                became the Watched. The Shepards all took up a single race of mortal
                and swore to guide them to success. And then, during the Great
                Conflicts, there came two groups: The Structure, who wanted to create
                an ordered, logical world… And the Freedom, who wanted to create a
                chaotic, complex world.</p>
