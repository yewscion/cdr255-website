* Overview
  This is the literate programming file for my [[https://cdr255.com][main website]], which I'm
  using to convert my old website into an org-based format (and then
  keep it up to date).
** README
   #+begin_src markdown :tangle README.md
     # cdr255-website

     `cdr255-website` is a literate programming repository for my [main
     website](https://cdr255.com/), including the HTML5, CSS3, and any
     extensions. All media assets (binary files of some sort) will be
     hosted on [linode](https://linode.com/).

     ## Installation

     If You want to create a tangled (production-ready) version of the
     website with this repo, clone it locally. Open the `cdr255.org` file
     in GNU/Emacs, and type `C-c C-v t` to tangle all of the files into
     their correct places. The `/public` directory is the production-ready
     site, and a version of it is likely currently live at
     [cdr255.com](https://cdr255.com/).

     ## Usage

     I have developed this site using a lot of concepts from Literate
     Programming, and leveraging Org Babel to keep things organized.

     ## Contributing
     Pull requests are not welcome, aside from efficiency/refactoring, as
     this is the repo of a personal site. However, feel free to use it as a
     base for Your own site, if You wish.

                        GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                            Version 3, 19 November 2007

      Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                                 Preamble

       The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
     software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
     cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

       The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
     to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
     our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
     share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
     software for all its users.

       When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
     price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
     them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
     want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
     free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

       Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
     with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
     you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
     and/or modify the software.

       A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
     improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
     receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
     incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
     encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
     software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
     The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
     letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
     source code to the public.

       The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
     ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
     to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
     provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
     users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
     a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
     code of the modified version.

       An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
     published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
     a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
     released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
     this license.

       The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
     modification follow.

                            TERMS AND CONDITIONS

       0. Definitions.

       "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

       "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
     works, such as semiconductor masks.

       "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

       To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
     in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
     exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
     earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

       A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
     on the Program.

       To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
     computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
     distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
     public, and in some countries other activities as well.

       To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
     a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

       An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
     extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
     work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
     the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
     menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

       1. Source Code.

       The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
     form of a work.

       A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
     standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
     interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
     is widely used among developers working in that language.

       The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
     than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
     packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
     Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
     Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
     implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
     "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
     (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
     (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
     produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

       The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
     control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
     System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
     programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
     which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
     includes interface definition files associated with source files for
     the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
     linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
     such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
     subprograms and other parts of the work.

       The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
     can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

       The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

       2. Basic Permissions.

       All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
     covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
     content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
     rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

       You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
     in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
     of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
     with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
     the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
     not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
     for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
     and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
     your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

       Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
     makes it unnecessary.

       3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

       No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
     11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
     similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
     measures.

       When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
     is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
     the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
     modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
     users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
     technological measures.

       4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

       You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
     keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
     recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

       You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

       5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

       You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

         a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
         it, and giving a relevant date.

         b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
         released under this License and any conditions added under section
         7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
         "keep intact all notices".

         c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
         License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
         License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
         additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
         regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
         permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
         invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

         d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
         Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
         interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
         work need not make them do so.

       A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
     and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
     in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
     "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
     used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
     beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
     in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
     parts of the aggregate.

       6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

       You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
     in one of these ways:

         a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
         (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
         Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
         customarily used for software interchange.

         b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
         (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
         written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
         long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
         model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
         copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
         product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
         medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
         more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
         conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
         Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

         c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
         written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
         alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
         only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
         with subsection 6b.

         d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
         place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
         Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
         further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
         Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
         copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
         may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
         that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
         clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
         Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
         Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
         available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

         e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
         you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
         Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
         charge under subsection 6d.

       A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
     from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
     included in conveying the object code work.

       A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
     tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
     or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
     into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
     doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
     product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
     typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
     of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
     actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
     is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
     commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
     the only significant mode of use of the product.

       "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
     and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
     a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
     suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
     code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
     modification has been made.

       If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
     specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
     part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
     User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
     fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
     Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
     by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
     if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
     modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
     been installed in ROM).

       The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
     requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
     for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
     the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
     network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
     adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
     protocols for communication across the network.

       Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
     in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
     documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
     source code form), and must require no special password or key for
     unpacking, reading or copying.

       7. Additional Terms.

       "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
     License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
     Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
     be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
     that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
     apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
     under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
     this License without regard to the additional permissions.

       When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
     it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
     add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
     that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

         a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
         terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

         b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
         author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
         Notices displayed by works containing it; or

         c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
         requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
         reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

         d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
         authors of the material; or

         e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
         trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

         f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
         material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
         it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
         any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
         those licensors and authors.

       All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
     received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
     governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
     a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
     License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
     of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
     not survive such relicensing or conveying.

       If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

       Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
     form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

       8. Termination.

       You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
     this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
     paragraph of section 11).

       However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
     holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
     prior to 60 days after the cessation.

       Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
     copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
     your receipt of the notice.

       Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
     licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
     this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
     reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
     material under section 10.

       9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

       You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
     to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
     nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
     modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
     not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
     covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

       10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

       Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
     for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

       An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
     work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
     give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
     Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
     the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

       You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
     not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
     rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
     (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
     any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
     sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

       11. Patents.

       A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
     work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

       A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
     by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
     but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
     consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
     purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
     patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
     this License.

       Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
     patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
     make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
     propagate the contents of its contributor version.

       In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
     agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
     (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
     sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
     party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
     patent against the party.

       If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
     and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
     to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
     publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
     then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
     available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
     patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
     license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
     actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
     covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
     in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

       If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
     or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
     you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
     work and works based on it.

       A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
     specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
     work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
     in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
     to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
     the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
     parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
     patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
     conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
     for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
     contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
     or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

       Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

       12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

       If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
     covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
     License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
     not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
     to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
     the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
     License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

       13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
     Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
     interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
     supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
     Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
     from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
     means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
     shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
     of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
     following paragraph.

       Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
     combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
     License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
     but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
     3 of the GNU General Public License.

       14. Revised Versions of this License.

       The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
     the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
     will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
     address new problems or concerns.

       Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
     Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
     option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
     version or of any later version published by the Free Software
     Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
     GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
     by the Free Software Foundation.

       If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
     public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
     to choose that version for the Program.

       Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

       15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

       THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
     OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
     THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
     IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
     ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

       16. Limitation of Liability.

       IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
     WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
     THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
     GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
     USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
     EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
     SUCH DAMAGES.

       17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

       If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
     an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
     Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
     copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

       If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
     free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

       To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
     to attach them to the start of e100 34523  100 34523    0     0   267k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  267k
     ach source file to most effectively
     state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
     the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

         <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
         Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

         This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
         it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
         the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
         (at your option) any later version.

         This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
         but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
         MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
         GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

         You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
         along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

       If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
     network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
     get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
     interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
     of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
     solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
     specific requirements.

       You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
     if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
     For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see

            <p>
              Decided to finally do a renovation on this site.
            </p>
            <p>
              (The last update was over three years ago, so I'd say it was long
              overdue!)
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm mostly keeping the content the same for now, as I want to
              focus on converting the old site to the new format first.
            </p>
          </aside>
          <h2>Today's Specials</h2>
          <article class="grid-by-3">
            <section>
              <h3>Music</h3>
              <h4>Thirteen Point Three</h4>
              <p>
                This is was my first (and only) entry into the 2017 <code>/r/songaweek</code>
                challenge!
              </p>
              <p>
                The theme was "Off by One", which I took a few different
                ways. First, I chose to write this piece in 5/4. Second, I chose
                to make this a three section piece (instead of my usual
                two). Finally, I tried to tell the (yet to be written out) story
                of Vir, a demigod in the fantasy story I'm currently working on
                whose trials and tribulations ultimately meant their own

                It was silent, save for the fan in the corner.

              <p>
                These big, metal boxes with grates on four sides were
                everywhere, and they all worked tirelessly to do two things:
                take in the old, stale air and revitalize it for another
                use, and pump the result back out into the same room. They
                were absolutely necessary, in a place with no trees or other
                flora to do the same job, and because of this it was vital
                that they remain clean and in working order.

                I'm a huge proponent of Free Software and Free Culture. My OS of

              </p>
              <p>
                I consider myself more of a software nerd than a hardware
                nerd. I am an unrepentent
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisper</a>;
                The first language I reach for is
                <a href="https://common-lisp.net/">Common Lisp</a>,
                but I use
                (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">GNU Guile</a>)
                <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/">Scheme</a>,

                and
                <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> when the situation
                calls for them. I especially
                like
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_processing">Text Processing</a> and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_manipulation_language">Data Manipulation</a>.
                For databases I prefer <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                I maintain a couple of websites other than this one. Here are
                the main ones:
              </p>
              <ul class="org-ul">
                <li>
                  <a href="https://yewscion.com/">Yewscion</a> - My Tech

              <p>
                As for this site, it is meant to be a hub of sorts for
                everything I publish, along with a repository of any content
                that doesn't fit on other sites (my homepage).

              <h3>Games</h3>
              <p>
                I am, and always have been, an avid gamer.
              </p>
              <p>
                I've recently moved more towards tabletop gaming, especially
                boardgames. I am active
                on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/user/yewscion">BoardGameGeek</a>. I've
                published relatively little of my own gaming content, though I
                still have some stuff in the works.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for video gaming, I prefer DRM-free releases and FLOSS
                projects when possible. I also prefer strategy / simulation
                games to the more twitchy ones, and much prefer a keyboard to a
                controller.
              </p>

              <h3>Music</h3>
              <p>
                I am a Harper, a Composer, and an Irish Traditional Musician.
              </p>
              <p>
                I love instrumental music the best, and have a large personal
                collection of MIDI and MOD files. Music I listen to in a wave
                format is usually stored in FLAC files. That said, I like all
                music, from Rap to Rock to Country to Metal.
              </p>
              <p>
                My own music is usually published in MIDI form at first, usually
                using <a href="https://lilypond.org">GNU Lilypond</a>. Then I
                will teach myself to play it on one instrument or another and
                make a recording of it after I'm happy with the MIDI
                composition. Unless otherwise stated, all of my work is
                published
                under
                <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA
                  4.0</a>.

              <h3>Writing</h3>
              <p>
                I enjoy reading and writing, but more as a hobby that anything
                else.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have many ongoing series on my Fiction Site, on which I
                publish little serial releases irregularly. The stories within I
                hope to use as the backdrop for my music or games eventualy,
                though its my hope that they will stand on their own as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                One day I may publish some of my work in a hard copy. If I do, it
                will be referenced here.

                <h3>Dorsht Seeker</h3>
                <p>The <dfn>Dorsht</dfn> are a race of mountain dwellers who live
                  inside the Kingdom of Falode, but maintain their own “country”
                  (in the mountain range to the South of Beebrook) through a
                  special alliance with the King. They have coarse, muted hair
                  that they often braid or dye, rough, pale brown skin from
                  spending so much of their lives indoors, and a stockier, rounder
                  build than those of the Falodians.</p>
                <p><dfn>Seekers</dfn> are those of the Dorsht who leave the
                  mountains in search of something, be it technology, absolution,
                  or purpose. There are thus many reasons the Dorsht might become
                  adventurers. Many will eventually return to the mountains; Those
                  that don’t before their demise become the new target for some
                  other Seeker.</p>
                <p>The Dorsht wear face paint each and every day. This face paint
                  is both reflective of their role in their society, their
                  personal history, and what they value in life. Each Dorsht has a
                  glyph that they alone are prescribed, which stays with them
                  through their entire lives and adorns their face each waking
                  day. This is the minimum they are willing to resort to, if they
                  cannot access their paints or doing so would be
                  inappropriate.</p>

                <h3>Ehdrin Traveler</h3>
                <p>The <dfn>Ehdrin are a reclusive people from the Isthmus beyond
                    the Western Borders of Falode. They are a tall, golden-tawny
                    people with brightly colored hair. Both their men and women have
                    no facial hair to speak of, though they tend to decorate their
                    hair with styling and beads.</p>
                <p>They are largely a reclusive people, rarely allowing foreigners
                  to come into contact with them. As a result, most Ehdrin
                  Adventurers are designated (in one way or another)
                  as <dfn>Travelers</dfn> for the Ehdrin: Ambassadors who ‘travel
                  the world looking for any events which might bring trouble to
                  the Ehdrin’ and are expected to report back, should something of
                  any magnitude come to pass.</p>
                <p>Ehdrin Travelers are, before their departure (or their exile) given
                  two tattoos: One on the back of each hand. The left is a regional one
                  that relates to their life before becoming a traveler. The right is a
                  personal, individual symbol used to identify them, and only
                  them. Through magic, these tattoos are echoed through their skin onto
                  their very bones, so that they might be identified should only their
                  skeleton remain intact.</p>

                <h3>Falodian Noble</h3>
                <p>The <dfn>Noble Class</dfn> in the Kingdom of Falonde is charged
                  with “Upholding the honor of Falonde to ourselves and others.”
                  They are fair-skinned, with dark brown or black hair. They
                  nearly all have violet eyes; Other colors are seen as a mixed
                  heritage of some sort. They tend to be of average height, with
                  women being slightly shorter than men.</p>
                <p>Nobles in Falode are charged with being observant and inclusive of all
                  around them at the expense of knowing history or studying. Though they
                  are the ‘ruling class’ of Falode, they view themselves lower than
                  others: They have been charged with a Duty to keep things working and
                  help others to live their lives in exchange for the resources and
                  freedom to enact that as best as they can from the Queen and King.</p>
                <p>Each Noble Family has a different Charge, with grouped families
                  sharing the same colors.  The rest of the specific coat of arms is
                  chosen by the individual, and all Nobles must have a coat of arms on
                  record with the king. They are given a set of ceremonial armor in
                  their family’s colors, which they are very used to wearing at all
                  formal events.</p>

                <h3>Falodian Commoner</h3>
                <p>Unlike Nobles, the <dfn>Peasantry</dfn> of the Kingdom of
                  Falode do not uphold much other than themselves (and
                  occasionally each other). They, as the nobles, tend to be fair
                  skinned, but have lighter colored hair and blue or brown
                  eyes. They tend to be of average height, with women slightly
                  shorter than men.</p>
                <p>Commoners try to eke out enough of a living to survive, and are
                  often forced to do manual labor of some sort. Their culture, in
                  possible response to the more world-mindedness of the nobles, is
                  very self involved. They become used to running, as time is a
                  premium and danger haunts the less populated areas. But, they
                  are quick learners, and become very good at what they choose to
                  do.</p>
                <p>Far from the complex coat of arms the Nobles concern themselves
                  with, each Commoner family gets their own secret sign, which
                  along with short symbols (like danger, friendly, emergency, and
                  such) form a sort of language used to communicate
                  information. This varies somewhat from town to town, but the big
                  symbols always stay the same (and family symbols are always
                  different).</p>

                <h3>Khula Trader</h3>
                <p>The <dfn>Khula</dfn> are a race of brown-skinned people who’ve
                  settled to the North of Beebrook, just outside the limits of the
                  Kingdom of Falode. They have coarse, dark hair, and green (and
                  sometimes hazel or brown) eyes. They are on the shorter side,
                  with women being taller than men.</p>
                <p>The Khula are an industrious people. The land they’ve decided
                  to call home is relatively isolated; what they cannot obtain
                  naturally they trade for from others. This has created a class
                  of Khula <dfn>Traders</dfn>, who leave their country regularly
                  in an effort to procure items, deals, and connections for their
                  homeland. Though it’s expected they return regularly, provided
                  they remain in contact with the Khula they can be out in the
                  field for years at a time.</p>
                <p>Each Khula Trader is given a cane, decorated with symbols
                  representing their family, their deeds, and their
                  specialties. They thus accumulate a breadth of symbols over the
                  course of their lives, but none is so important as the top of
                  the cane, which is often an ornate crystal of some kind, set
                  with a design that is uniquely their own.</p>

                <h3>Viliniti Diasporan</h3>
                <p>The <dfn>Viliniti</dfn> used to live in what is now Eastern
                  Falode. They are a short people with ochre colored skin and dark
                  colored hair and eyes. They are graceful, both in movement and
                  deed, but their rather sparse way of life leaves them more frail
                  than others.</p>
                <p>The Viliniti now live among the Falode in small, discrete
                  groups. Though Eastern Falode belonged to them a few centuries
                  ago, there are only a small number of people who still feel they
                  should not cooperate with the Kingdom (to a point- they still
                  look out for their own, just without active rebellion). They are
                  naturally migratory, and thus any Viliniti might become an
                  adventurer.</p>
                <p>The Viliniti have always had a ‘knack with animals’. They have
                  a heightened sense of smell, and seem to be able to communicate
                  fairly well with animals around them. They spend a lot of their
                  lives travel ling, and have developed watchful eyes to prevent
                  themselves from falling under misfortune.</p>
                <p>Every Viliniti has a necklace with charms on it to remember
                  important events in their life- including their birth. They are
                  very protective of this necklace, though they have more than
                  memorized each symbol it holds, and can recount with unerring
                  detail each part of it, should it be destroyed. But, only a very
                  small number of things will force a Viliniti to sacrifice their
                  necklace.</p>

                    With all their colors shown and their shields to the sky.<br />

                    As symbols they must stand alone, bereft of any sin,<br />

                    Even if the consequences turn themselves estranged<br />
                    When doing Good it is important to remain impartial<br />
                    The law is right and wrong at times, true justice is oft martial.<br />
                    We’re soldiers first, of sword and helm, and so we do not lead,<br />
                    We’re soldiers first, with sword and helm, so that we do not bleed.<br />
                    In disagreement, duels all must be held up to our eyes,<br />
                    And none might die or lose a limb because one of us lies.<br />
                    When we begin a task or quest we always see it through,<br />
                    Because the Knight of Falode always parcels what is due.<br />

              <h1>Falodian Pantheon</h1>
              <p>This is the officially recognized pantheon for the Kingdom of Falode.</p>
              <p>It is by no means exhaustive; Other Gods and Goddesses are worshipped
                throughout the land, but are either too minor or too contrary to be
                officially noted here yet. Every major metropolitan area in Falode is
                required by Royal Law to have a shrine to each of these deities. Small
                towns, of course, are not.</p>
              <p>The Deities of the Falodian Pantheon form themselves into various groups.</p>
              <p>Firstly, the Hierarchy: There were once only ten deities. Of these ten,
                two stood up and took control: Alil and Jeha. They took up the cause
                of defending the Fates. The others would defer to them, but keep their
                own individuality for the most part, and became Beholden to the
                Fates. Over time, various Children were born to them all: They became
                the Children of the Fates.</p>
              <p>Secondly, there are groupings based on Status and Culture: Gods and
                Goddesses, first, to promote an easy way to divide the group. Then,
                there were some who began work on some… questionable goals. These
                became the Watched. The Shepards all took up a single race of mortal
                and swore to guide them to success. And then, during the Great
                Conflicts, there came two groups: The Structure, who wanted to create
                an ordered, logical world… And the Freedom, who wanted to create a
                chaotic, complex world.</p>
