        <h3>Dorsht Seeker</h3>
        <p>The <dfn>Dorsht</dfn> are a race of mountain dwellers who live
          inside the Kingdom of Falode, but maintain their own “country”
          (in the mountain range to the South of Beebrook) through a
          special alliance with the King. They have coarse, muted hair
          that they often braid or dye, rough, pale brown skin from
          spending so much of their lives indoors, and a stockier, rounder
          build than those of the Falodians.</p>
        <p><dfn>Seekers</dfn> are those of the Dorsht who leave the
          mountains in search of something, be it technology, absolution,
          or purpose. There are thus many reasons the Dorsht might become
          adventurers. Many will eventually return to the mountains; Those
          that don’t before their demise become the new target for some
          other Seeker.</p>
        <p>The Dorsht wear face paint each and every day. This face paint
          is both reflective of their role in their society, their
          personal history, and what they value in life. Each Dorsht has a
          glyph that they alone are prescribed, which stays with them
          through their entire lives and adorns their face each waking
          day. This is the minimum they are willing to resort to, if they
          cannot access their paints or doing so would be
          inappropriate.</p>

        <h3>Ehdrin Traveler</h3>
        <p>The <dfn>Ehdrin are a reclusive people from the Isthmus beyond
            the Western Borders of Falode. They are a tall, golden-tawny
            people with brightly colored hair. Both their men and women have
            no facial hair to speak of, though they tend to decorate their
            hair with styling and beads.</p>
        <p>They are largely a reclusive people, rarely allowing foreigners
          to come into contact with them. As a result, most Ehdrin
          Adventurers are designated (in one way or another)
          as <dfn>Travelers</dfn> for the Ehdrin: Ambassadors who ‘travel
          the world looking for any events which might bring trouble to
          the Ehdrin’ and are expected to report back, should something of
          any magnitude come to pass.</p>
        <p>Ehdrin Travelers are, before their departure (or their exile) given
          two tattoos: One on the back of each hand. The left is a regional one
          that relates to their life before becoming a traveler. The right is a
          personal, individual symbol used to identify them, and only
          them. Through magic, these tattoos are echoed through their skin onto
          their very bones, so that they might be identified should only their
          skeleton remain intact.</p>

        <h3>Falodian Noble</h3>
        <p>The <dfn>Noble Class</dfn> in the Kingdom of Falonde is charged
          with “Upholding the honor of Falonde to ourselves and others.”
          They are fair-skinned, with dark brown or black hair. They
          nearly all have violet eyes; Other colors are seen as a mixed
          heritage of some sort. They tend to be of average height, with
          women being slightly shorter than men.</p>
        <p>Nobles in Falode are charged with being observant and inclusive of all
          around them at the expense of knowing history or studying. Though they
          are the ‘ruling class’ of Falode, they view themselves lower than
          others: They have been charged with a Duty to keep things working and
          help others to live their lives in exchange for the resources and
          freedom to enact that as best as they can from the Queen and King.</p>
        <p>Each Noble Family has a different Charge, with grouped families
          sharing the same colors.  The rest of the specific coat of arms is
          chosen by the individual, and all Nobles must have a coat of arms on
          record with the king. They are given a set of ceremonial armor in
          their family’s colors, which they are very used to wearing at all
          formal events.</p>

        <h3>Falodian Commoner</h3>
        <p>Unlike Nobles, the <dfn>Peasantry</dfn> of the Kingdom of
          Falode do not uphold much other than themselves (and
          occasionally each other). They, as the nobles, tend to be fair
          skinned, but have lighter colored hair and blue or brown
          eyes. They tend to be of average height, with women slightly
          shorter than men.</p>
        <p>Commoners try to eke out enough of a living to survive, and are
          often forced to do manual labor of some sort. Their culture, in
          possible response to the more world-mindedness of the nobles, is
          very self involved. They become used to running, as time is a
          premium and danger haunts the less populated areas. But, they
          are quick learners, and become very good at what they choose to
          do.</p>
        <p>Far from the complex coat of arms the Nobles concern themselves
          with, each Commoner family gets their own secret sign, which
          along with short symbols (like danger, friendly, emergency, and
          such) form a sort of language used to communicate
          information. This varies somewhat from town to town, but the big
          symbols always stay the same (and family symbols are always
          different).</p>

        <h3>Khula Trader</h3>
        <p>The <dfn>Khula</dfn> are a race of brown-skinned people who’ve
          settled to the North of Beebrook, just outside the limits of the
          Kingdom of Falode. They have coarse, dark hair, and green (and
          sometimes hazel or brown) eyes. They are on the shorter side,
          with women being taller than men.</p>
        <p>The Khula are an industrious people. The land they’ve decided
          to call home is relatively isolated; what they cannot obtain
          naturally they trade for from others. This has created a class
          of Khula <dfn>Traders</dfn>, who leave their country regularly
          in an effort to procure items, deals, and connections for their
          homeland. Though it’s expected they return regularly, provided
          they remain in contact with the Khula they can be out in the
          field for years at a time.</p>
        <p>Each Khula Trader is given a cane, decorated with symbols
          representing their family, their deeds, and their
          specialties. They thus accumulate a breadth of symbols over the
          course of their lives, but none is so important as the top of
          the cane, which is often an ornate crystal of some kind, set
          with a design that is uniquely their own.</p>

        <h3>Viliniti Diasporan</h3>
        <p>The <dfn>Viliniti</dfn> used to live in what is now Eastern
          Falode. They are a short people with ochre colored skin and dark
          colored hair and eyes. They are graceful, both in movement and
          deed, but their rather sparse way of life leaves them more frail
          than others.</p>
        <p>The Viliniti now live among the Falode in small, discrete
          groups. Though Eastern Falode belonged to them a few centuries
          ago, there are only a small number of people who still feel they
          should not cooperate with the Kingdom (to a point- they still
          look out for their own, just without active rebellion). They are
          naturally migratory, and thus any Viliniti might become an
          adventurer.</p>
        <p>The Viliniti have always had a ‘knack with animals’. They have
          a heightened sense of smell, and seem to be able to communicate
          fairly well with animals around them. They spend a lot of their
          lives travel ling, and have developed watchful eyes to prevent
          themselves from falling under misfortune.</p>
        <p>Every Viliniti has a necklace with charms on it to remember
          important events in their life- including their birth. They are
          very protective of this necklace, though they have more than
          memorized each symbol it holds, and can recount with unerring
          detail each part of it, should it be destroyed. But, only a very
          small number of things will force a Viliniti to sacrifice their
          necklace.</p>
