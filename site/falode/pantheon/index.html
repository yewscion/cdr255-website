      <h1>Falodian Pantheon</h1>
      <p>This is the officially recognized pantheon for the Kingdom of Falode.</p>
      <p>It is by no means exhaustive; Other Gods and Goddesses are worshipped
        throughout the land, but are either too minor or too contrary to be
        officially noted here yet. Every major metropolitan area in Falode is
        required by Royal Law to have a shrine to each of these deities. Small
        towns, of course, are not.</p>
      <p>The Deities of the Falodian Pantheon form themselves into various groups.</p>
      <p>Firstly, the Hierarchy: There were once only ten deities. Of these ten,
        two stood up and took control: Alil and Jeha. They took up the cause
        of defending the Fates. The others would defer to them, but keep their
        own individuality for the most part, and became Beholden to the
        Fates. Over time, various Children were born to them all: They became
        the Children of the Fates.</p>
      <p>Secondly, there are groupings based on Status and Culture: Gods and
        Goddesses, first, to promote an easy way to divide the group. Then,
        there were some who began work on some… questionable goals. These
        became the Watched. The Shepards all took up a single race of mortal
        and swore to guide them to success. And then, during the Great
        Conflicts, there came two groups: The Structure, who wanted to create
        an ordered, logical world… And the Freedom, who wanted to create a
        chaotic, complex world.</p>
